A fully coded web-based memory game hosted on (https://vxentino.neocities.org)

## Overview
This project was designed and developed entirely from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a creative, interactive memory game set in a cosmic theme that pushes beyond traditional web exercises. 

As a freshman Computer Science major, I built this project to challenge myself to understand how logic, visuals, and animation could come together without relying on pre built frameworks or templates. Every feature from the gameplay logic to the transitions and sound interactions was coded manually.

## Features and Design
- **Core Memory Game Mechanics:** I programmed the entire logic system that handles card flipping, randomization, matching checks, score tracking, and progressive difficulty.
- **Interactive Boss Fight:** At the end of the memory sequence, players face a coded “boss” event that tests timing and pattern recognition. The sequence reacts dynamically to player actions using condition-based JavaScript.
- **Cinematic Cutscenes:** Between stages, I created short animated cutscenes using pure JavaScript and CSS transitions. These scenes help build a small narrative without using any external engines or tools.
- **Custom Visual Effects:** I wrote scripts to generate starfields, glows, and ambient movement that respond to player progress, giving the game an atmospheric look and feel.
- **Completely Code-Driven:** No visual editors or engines were used — every part of the gameplay, animation, and event logic was built through direct code.

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structure
- CSS for animation and responsive layout
- JavaScript for all interactive gameplay and logic
- Basic DOM manipulation for scene transitions and UI effects

## My Process
I started with simple prototypes, experimenting with how to handle memory-matching logic through arrays and event listeners. Once that foundation worked, I layered more advanced ideas — enemy logic, reactive animations, and sequential storytelling all while keeping the code organized and readable.  
This project taught me about problem solving, debugging, and the importance of structuring logic to scale creative ideas effectively.

## Future Plans
- Add save functionality using localStorage  
- Introduce soundtracks and SFX triggers  
- Expand the storyline and boss encounters
