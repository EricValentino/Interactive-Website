# Interactive-Website

A fully coded web-based memory game created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features interactive gameplay mechanics, an original boss fight, and custom animated cutscenes all programmed manually without game engines or templates. Built to explore game logic, animation, and storytelling entirely through code, this project demonstrates my interest in game development, creative design, and problem solving as a freshman Computer Science major.
